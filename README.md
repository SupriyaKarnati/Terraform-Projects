# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Project

This repository contains Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The infrastructure is automated using Terraform to ensure a consistent, repeatable, and scalable cloud environment.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Terraform to create and manage various AWS resources, including but not limited to:

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
- **EC2 instances**
- **S3 Buckets**
- **IAM roles and policies**
- **Security Groups**
- **DynamoDB tables**

Terraform will be used to automate the entire lifecycle of these AWS resources, including creation, modification, and destruction.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Terraform project, ensure the following:

- **Terraform**: You need to have Terraform installed on your machine. You can install it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
  
- **AWS CLI**: Make sure the AWS CLI is installed and configured with your AWS credentials. You can configure it by running:
  
  ```bash
